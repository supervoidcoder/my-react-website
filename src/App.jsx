                Hi! I am <a href="https://github.com/supervoidcoder/">supervoidcoder</a>, known as <a href="https://youtube.com/@greencuby">Green Cube</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/scratchcode1_2_3">scratchcode1_2_3</a> on other platforms. I love programming, making games (and playing them too, heh), making animations, writing stories, and other fun tech stuff! I like to do both software and hardware-related things, though I have much more experience with software. I know my fair share of programming languages too, from Scratch, Python, JavaScript (+ React framework), to quite a bit of C++! Iâ€™ve also played around a bit in C# and Kotlin, but not that much.
            </p>
            <p className="zoom yap">
                On the hardware side of things, Iâ€™ve used Raspberry Pi's quite a bit. I own 3 Raspberry Piâ€™s: one Raspberry Pi 4B and two Raspberry Pi Zero 2W's. Iâ€™ve used them for stuff like a plane, a mini server, playing games with Batocera. I've also tried out micro:bit once (it was uh...) and even fixed my laptop once!
            </p>
            <p className="zoom yap">
                My first and main website is <a href="https://greencuby.com">https://greencuby.com</a>, where I post most of my tools, games, and helpful stuff, although since I wrote it when I was really young and I just keep adding stuff onto it, it's practically just an amalgamation of w3schools tutorials, inconsistencies, under construction pages, and dead links XD
                It's also cool because it has a custom domain, and isn't the default github domain ;)
                Check out all my websites and socials below!

                If you want to contact me, the fastest way is through Scratch. I check it almost every day, so I will probably respond quickly. You can also contact me through GitHub or YouTube, but I might not respond as fast.

Unlike the Green Cube website, which aims to make useful tools for the average tech user/student, OmniBlocks is more focused on programming and development-related things. It's main attraction at the moment (and the most worked on feature) is the OmniBlocks IDE, a multilanguage IDE. Learn more on the website itself. There's actually not much info there yet, but there will be. (p.s) it's just a turbowarp mod for now" />
