    In my case, I had an issue with the zooming animations. I first used @keyframes to make a hover animation when card:hover. However,
    if you moved the mouse away from the card, it would zoom out instantly, which was not what I wanted. I wanted it to zoom out smoothly.
    So I used the :not() selector to apply a different animation when the card is not hovered. This way, it zooms out smoothly.
    First, I went straight for the transition rule. It usually works. however, in the class, I had a conflicting animation: zoom, 
    making it do absolutely nothing. I was stuck. I had to choose what animation to keep because I couldn't keep both of them.
    I really liked the zoom upon load though. I couldn't just give it away for a hover animation. Why not just have both?
    So I found out about the :not() selector. And it was a lifesaver! Definitely something you can't forget.

    things and overthink them to the point where I make them more complicated than they need to be. I could have just used transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out; and it would have worked perfectly fine. */
